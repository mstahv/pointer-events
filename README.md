Pointer event library for GWT
=============================

This Vaadin sponsored GWT library contains a basic support for [Pointer Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/). The library supports both prefixed version in IE10 and non-prefixed version in IE11+.

At least GWT version 2.6.0-rc2 is needed to use this library.

The implementation is pretty much the same that will most likely appear built into next major [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/) version, but can be thrown into any GWT project. 

Module name to inherit is "com.vaadin.pointerevents.PointerEvents"

Builds will be available via https://vaadin.com/directory
